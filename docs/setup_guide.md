just follow the manual in the docs folder

Ros2 - iron irwino version supports ubuntu 22.04 https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/Releases/Release-Iron-Irwini.html
but rasberry pi 5 does not support ubuntu 22.04

so intead i think im gonna use the latest ubuntu and just manually add ros2: https://lkseng.github.io/posts/2024/01/07/ros-2-humble-on-raspberrypi-5.html
on ubuntu it works fine following the link but its for installing the full ros2. like what you would do for the master.

I used iron irwino version. this is the docs:
